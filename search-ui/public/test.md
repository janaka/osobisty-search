## ADsdf @ 345 about CTO opportunity

Works with PE backed companies.
 
Change transformation management specialist. Consultancy.

50-60 ppl
founded in 2003
2 primary shareholders. founders.

ASFSDF are looking to asdfd the sdfdhgjk. Management buyout in the next 2-5yrs

Sounds like the are trying to automate the lower end of the market and pushing consultants up to hire value deals as the only way to scale the business. I assume they will remain a consultancy centric business that is augmented by the SaaS product for the lower end. fgjhj dfgl;j dsfgll dlfgj sdfg ljv0puretmmmmcsr,zfpougsrkjgjdflit

Told her that this one doesn't sound like a fit for me.
